## What is a STAR Election?
<br />
In STAR, voters are given a score ballot (or ratings ballot) on which each voter scores candidates with a number from 0 up to 5, with 0 representing "worst" and 5 representing "best."

The scores for each candidate are then summed, and the two highest-scored candidates are selected as finalists.

In the automatic runoff round, the finalist who was given a higher score on a greater number of ballots is selected as the winner.
